This folder contains all the non-standard UI resources required by the system—resources that aren’t included in the standard Home Assistant package. Managing them here eliminates the need for a HACS (Home Assistant Community Store) installation on the target system, thereby reducing external dependencies and simplifying deployment.

Additional Notes:

Self-Contained Management:
By hosting these resources locally, you ensure that the UI remains fully functional without relying on third-party stores or additional installations.

Periodic Updates:
It’s crucial to periodically review the libraries contained in this folder to verify whether updates are needed. Regular checks help maintain compatibility, incorporate new features, and address potential security vulnerabilities.

Version Control:
Consider implementing version control or tracking mechanisms for these libraries. This practice will assist in managing updates and maintaining consistency across deployments.

By keeping these resources up-to-date and well-managed, you help ensure a stable and secure UI experience without the overhead of additional dependency management.
